\section{Conceptual Questions (10 points)}
\begin{itemize}
\item[a.]  (L3, 2') Given the same parameters, does DBSCAN always output the same cluster assignment or not? Briefly explain.
\item[b.]  (L3, 2') With improper choice of initial cluster centers, K-Means can give us a very bad clustering output. Could you propose a method to alleviate the issue?
\item[c.]  (L1, 2') Between $k$-Medoids (PAM) and $k$-Means, which is more efficient? Briefly explain.
\item[d.]  (L1, 2') OPTICS is superior to DBSCAN because we do not have to set the paramenter $\epsilon$. True or False? Briefly explain.
\item[e.] (L1, 2') Is it true that Lazy learners (e.g., $k$NN) is more efficient than non-lazy learners (e.g., decision trees)?
